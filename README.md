# linkblog-markdown
A VS Code extension that generates markdown from an RSS feed to create a linkblog post.

This extension will use the the same logic and configuration data used by my [linkblog plugin](https://github.com/alvinashcraft/linkblog-lwplugin) for Open LiveWriter and Windows LiveWriter.
